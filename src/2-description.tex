\subsection{Software Architecture}
\label{sec:architecture}

% Give a short overview of the overall software architecture; provide a pictorial component overview
% or similar (if possible). If necessary provide implementation details.

\ragnicas~is an object oriented AD gem that supports some simple computer algebra routines such as \emph{simplifications} and \emph{substitutions}. When gem is required, automatically overloads some methods of the \Fixnum~and \Float~classes, to make them compatible with the foundamental symbolic objects.

Each symbolic function is an object modeled by a class, that inherits from a common virtual ancestor: \CASOp (operation). An operation encapsulates sub-operations recursively, building a linked graph, that is the mathematical equivalent of function composition:
\begin{equation}
\left( f \, \circ \, g \right)
\end{equation}

\caption{Example graph from the first function reported in script~\ref{code:example-diff}}
\end{figure}

When a new operation is created, it is appended to the graph. The number of branches are determined by the parent container class of the current symbolic function. There are three possible containers. Single argument functions --- e.g. $\sin(\cdot)$ --- have as closest parent the \CASOp~class, that links to one sub-graph. Functions with two arguments --- e.g.\ difference or exponential function --- inherit from \CASBinaryOp, that links to two subgraphs. Functions with arbitrary number of arguments --- e.g.\ sum and product --- have as parent the \CASNaryOp\footnote{Please note that this container is still at experimental stage}, that links to an arbitrary number of subgraph. Figure~\ref{fig:graph} contains an example of graph. The different kind of containers allows to introduce some properties like \emph{associativity} and \emph{commutativity}. Each container exposes the subgraphs as instance properties. Containers structure is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:uml-container}.

Terminal leaf of the graph are the two classes \CASConstant~and \CASVariable. The first is a node for a simple numerical value, while the latter represents an independent variable, that can be used to perform derivatives and evaluations. As for now, those nodes are only scalar numbers, with plans to define also the vectorial and matricial extensions in the next major release.

Automatic differentiation (\CASOpdiff) crosses the graph until it reaches the ending node. The terminal node is the starting point for derivatives accumulation, the mathematical equivalent of the chain rule:
\begin{equation}
\left( f  \, \circ \, g \right)' \: = \:
\left( f' \, \circ \, g \right) \: g'
\end{equation}
The recursiveness is used also for simplifications (\CASOpsimplify), substitutions (\CASOpsubs) and evaluations (\CASOpcall).

\subsection{Software Functionalities}
\label{sec:functionalities}

% Present the major functionalities of the software.

The main functionality of the library is the \textbf{AD}, that can be performed with respect to an independent variable (\CASVariable), even for implicit functions. The differentiation is done by a method of the \CASOp, having a \CASVariable as argument:
\begin{lstlisting}
\label{code:example-diff}
x = CAS.vars 'x'           # creates a variable
f = x ** 2 + 1             # define a symbolic expression
f.diff(x)                  # derivative w.r.t. x
# => 2 * x ^ (2 - 1) + 0
g = CAS.declare :g, f      # creates implicit function
g.diff(x)                  # derivative w.r.t. x
# => (2 * x ^ (2 - 1) + 0) * Dg[0](x ^ 2)
\end{lstlisting}

Resulting graph still contains a zero, since \textbf{simplifications} are not executed automatically. Each node of the graph contains some rules for simplify itself. Simplification are called recursively inside the graph, exactly like AD, bringing the strong limitation of not handling simplifications that come from \emph{heuristic expansion} of sub-graphs --- e.g.\ simplification through the use of trigonometric identities. Those simplification can be achieved manually using \textbf{substitutions}.
\begin{lstlisting}
\label{code:example-subs}
x, y = CAS::vars 'x', 'y'        # creates two variables
f = CAS.log( CAS.sin( y ) )      # symbolic expression
f.subs  y: CAS.asin(CAS.exp(x))  # perform substitution
f.simplify                       # simplify expression
# => x
\end{lstlisting}

The graph can be \textbf{evaluated} substituting defining some values for the independent variable in a feed dictionary. The graph is recursively reduced to a single numeric value:
\begin{lstlisting}
\label{code:example-call}
x = CAS::vars 'x'          # creates a variable
f = x ** 2 + 1             # define a symbolic expression
f.call x: 2                # evaluate for x = 2
# => 5
\end{lstlisting}

Symbolic functions can be used to create expressions --- e.g. $f(\cdot) \geq g(\cdot)$ --- or piecewise functions --- e.g. $\max(f(\cdot), g(\cdot))$:
\begin{lstlisting}
x = CAS::vars 'x'
f = x ** 2
g = 2 * x + 1
f.greater_equal g
# => ((x)^(3) >= ((2 * x) + 1))
CAS::max f, g
# => (((x)^(3) >= ((2 * x) + 1)) ? (x)^(3) : ((2 * x) + 1))
\end{lstlisting}
Expression are stored in a special container class, called \CASExpression.

The library is developed explicitly for \textbf{generation of code}, and in some case also \textbf{meta\-programming}. Expressions, once manipulated, can be easily exported as source code (in a defined language ---i.e. the following example in standard \Ruby~code):
\begin{lstlisting}
x = CAS::vars 'x'            # creates a variable
f = CAS::log(CAS::sin(x))    # define a symbolic function
# => Math::log(Math::sin(x))
\end{lstlisting}
the same function can be also used to create directly a callable \emph{closure}, as a \texttt{Proc} object:
\begin{lstlisting}
proc = f.as_proc             # exports callable lambda
proc.call 'x' => Math::PI/2
# => 0.0
\end{lstlisting}
Must be noted that parsing the graph creates a snapshot, and any further modification to the expression will not update the callable object. This drawback is balanced by faster execution time of the \texttt{Proc}: when a graph needs only to be evaluated in a iterative algorithm, and not to be manipulated, transforming it in a \emph{closure} reduces the execution time per loop.
