\subsection{Software Architecture}
\label{sec:architecture}

% Give a short overview of the overall software architecture; provide a pictorial component overview
% or similar (if possible). If necessary provide implementation details.

\ragnicas~is an object oriented ASD gem that supports some computer algebra routines such as \emph{simplifications} and \emph{substitutions}. When gem is required, it overloads methods of \Fixnum~and \Float~classes, making them compatible with foundamental symbolic classes.

Each symbolic expression (or operation) is the instance of an object, that inherits from a common virtual ancestor: \CASOp. An operation encapsulates sub-operations recursively, building a linked tree, that is the mathematical equivalent of function composition:
\begin{equation}
\left( f \, \circ \, g \right)
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[ht!]

\input{img/graph-ex}

\end{figure}

When a new operation is created, it is appended to the tree. The number of branches are determined by the parent container class of the current symbolic function. There are three possible containers. Single argument operations --- e.g. $\sin(\cdot)$ --- have as closest parent the \CASOp~class, that links to one sub-tree. Expressions with two arguments --- e.g.\ difference or exponential function --- inherit from \CASBinaryOp, that links to two sub-tree. Operations with arbitrary number of arguments --- e.g.\ sum and product --- have as parent the \CASNaryOp\footnote{Please note that this container is still at experimental stage}, that links to an arbitrary number of sub-tree. Figure~\ref{fig:graph} contains a graphical representation. The different kind of containers allows to introduce some properties --- i.e. \emph{associativity} and \emph{commutativity} for sums and multiplications~\cite{cohen2003computer}. Each container exposes the sub-tree as instance properties. Containers interfaces and inheritances are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:uml-container}. %TODO issue with image label

Terminal leafes of the graph are the classes \CASConstant, \CASVariable~and \CASFunction. The first models a simple numerical value, while the second represents an independent variable, that can be used to perform derivatives and evaluations, and the latter is a prototype of implicit functions. As for now, those leafes exemplify only real scalar expressions, with definition of complex, vectorial and matricial extensions as milestones for the next major release.

SD (\CASOpdiff) crosses the graph until it reaches ending nodes. A terminal node is the starting point for derivatives accumulation, the mathematical equivalent of the chain rule:
\begin{equation}
\left( f  \, \circ \, g \right)' \: = \:
\left( f' \, \circ \, g \right) \: g'
\end{equation}
The recursiveness is used also for simplifications (\CASOpsimplify), substitutions (\CASOpsubs), evaluations (\CASOpcall) and code generation.

\subsection{Software Functionalities}
\label{sec:functionalities}

\subsubsection{Software installation and prerequisites}

\emph{No additional dependencies are required}. The gem can be installed through \emph{rubygems.org} provider\footnote{\texttt{gem install Mr.CAS}}. Functionalities must be required runtime using the Kernel method: \texttt{require \'Mr.CAS\'}. All methods and classes are incapsulated in the module \texttt{CAS}.

\subsubsection{Basic Functionalities}
% Present the major functionalities of the software.
\textbf{SD} is performed with respect to independent variables (\CASVariable) through forward accumulation, even for implicit functions. The differentiation is done by the method \CASOpdiff, having a \CASVariable~as argument:

\noindent%
\lstinputlisting[caption={Differentiation example},label={code:example-diff}]{./scripts/listing_01.rb}

\textbf{Automatic differentiation} (AD) is included as plugin and exploits dual numbers~\cite{bartholomew2000automatic}. This differentiation strategy is useful in case of complex expressions, when explicit derivative's tree may exceed the call stack depth, that is platform dependent.

\textbf{Simplifications} are not executed automatically, after differentiations. Each node of the tree knows rules for simplify itself, and rules are called recursively, exactly like ASD.\@ Simplifications that require an \emph{heuristic expansion} of the subgraph --- i.e.\ some trigonometric identities --- are not defined for now, but can be easily achieved through \textbf{substitutions}:

\noindent%
\lstinputlisting[caption={Simplification example},label={code:example-simp}]{./scripts/listing_02.rb}

The tree is numerically \textbf{evaluated} when independent variables values are provided in a feed dictionary. The graph is reduced recursively to a single numeric value:

\noindent%
\lstinputlisting[caption={Tree evaluation example},label={code:example-call}]{./scripts/listing_03.rb}


Symbolic expressions can be used to create comparative expressions, that are stored in special container classes, modeled by the ancestor \CASExpression~--- e.g. $f(\cdot) \geq g(\cdot)$. This allow the definition of piecewise functions --- e.g. $\max(f(\cdot), g(\cdot))$.

\noindent%
\lstinputlisting[caption={Expressions and Piecewise functions},label={code:example-expr}]{./scripts/listing_04.rb}

\subsubsection{Metaprogramming and Code-Generation}

\ragnicas~is developed explicitly for \textbf{meta\-programming} and \textbf{generation of code}. Expressions can be exported as source code or used as prototypes for callable \emph{closures} (\texttt{Proc} objects):

\noindent%
\lstinputlisting[caption={Graph evaluation example},label={code:example-proc}]{./scripts/listing_05.rb}

Compiling a closure of a tree is like making its snapshot, thus any further manipulation of the expression do not update the callable object. This drawback is balanced by the faster execution time of a \texttt{Proc}: when a graph needs \emph{only to be evaluated} in a iterative algorithm, transforming it in a \emph{closure} reduces the execution time per iteration.

Code generation should be flexible enough to export expressions' trees in a user's target language. Generation methods for common languages are included in specific \textbf{plugins}. Users can furthemore expand exporting capabilites by writing specific exportation rules,  overriding method for existing plugin, or desining their own exporter:
