\ragnicas~is a midpoint between a CAS and an ASD library. It allows to manipulate expressions while mantaining the complete control on how the code is exported. Each rule is overloaded and applied runtime, without the need of compilation. Each user's model may include the mathematical description, code generation rules and high level logic that should be intrisic to such a rule --- e.g.~exporting gradients as \textbf{patterns} instead of matrices.

Our research group is including \texttt{Mr.CAS} in a solver for optimal control problem with indirect methods, as interface for problems' description~\cite{biral2016notes}.

As a long term ambitious impact, this library will become a complete CAS for \Ruby~language, filling the empty space reported by \emph{SciRuby} for symbolic math engines.
