\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

% Set out the conclusion of this original software publication.
This work presents a pure \Ruby~library that implements a minimalistics CAS with
automatic and symbolic differentiation that is aimed at code generation or metaprogramming.
The library is still at an early developing stage, but with promising feature, some of them
shown in section~\ref{sec:examples}. This is the only gem that implements
such a functionality for this language.

Language features allows to use library as an interface, simplifying model definition
for numerical algorithms. All core functionalities and basic math are defined, with the plan to expand
capabilities furthemore as milestones for next major releases. Reopening a class guarantees a
\emph{liquid} library 

Library is published in repository \emph{rubygems.org} and versioned on \emph{github.com}. It can be included easily in projects and in inline interpreter, or installed as a standalone gem.
